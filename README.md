*The page and style
-The page is built similar to the example html, but i rebuilt it, to be more familiar with it.
-the css style is much more simpler than the one used in the example
-some modification is made to syle to accumudate changes in view size between diffrent devices, mainly the use of the overflow function 
-there is a background image but it is linked in through the internet

*Methodology
-in this landing page i use a method where i calculate the visable area of a section on the screen,and using the assumption 
that the section of with the biggest area on the screen is the Section we want to focus on, i highlight it and the list item indicating it in the navigator menu
-if there this no activity, the navigation menu gets hidden

*Testing
-testing of the page has been done using mozila developer tool where it had anaverage of 59 frames on a 60hz monitor
